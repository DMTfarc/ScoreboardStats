By operating over packets, we can workaround this.\r\nFor this method, you'll need ProtocolLib. It's used to prevent conflicts with\r\nother plugins which also access the sidebar objective. Otherwise the client\r\ncould crash.\r\n\r\nThese plugins are (tested) compatible (just activate comaptibilityMode):\r\n* HealthBar (http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/health-bar/)\r\n* ColoredTags (http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/colored-tags/)\r\n* GhostPlayer (http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/ghost-player/)\r\n* McCombatLevel (http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/mccombatlevel/)\r\n\r\n###Building\r\n\r\nScoreboardStats uses Maven 3 to manage building configurations,\r\n    general project informations and dependencies.\r\nYou can compile this project yourself by using Maven.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Just import the project from [Github](http://github.com/).\r\n    Your IDE would detect the Maven project.\r\n* If not: Download it from [here](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)\r\n    You will find executable in the bin folder.\r\n* Run (using IDE, console or something else)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
